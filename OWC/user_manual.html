<h2 id="user-manual">USER MANUAL</h2>
<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This guide is oriented to anyone who wants to use the <strong>OWC</strong> application, the new Graphical User Interface for the DHuS, based on Google Polymer library.<br/> This new GUI offers the same functionalities of the traditional one, with additional features devoted mainly to improve application configuration. <strong>OWC</strong> development is still ongoing, so there will be both improvements on existing functionalities and new features implementation.<br/> Furthermore, the <strong>OWC</strong> project is <em>Open Source</em>, with the goal of creating a community of developers interested in implementing new web components suitable to the dissemination of space products. Thanks to modularity and extensibility principles, components implemented by <em>Open Source</em> community can be dynamically imported in the OWC application on the basis of the users' needs.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites-and-constraints">Prerequisites and Constraints</h2>
<p>Since <strong>OWC</strong> application is based on Web Components standard, which is not supported yet on all browsers, OWC GUI works only with recent distribution of Google Chrome.</p>
<h2 id="application-menu">Application Menu</h2>
<p><strong>OWC</strong> main page shows the application menu on a configurable background image.</p>
<p>
<span class="image featured"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10920750/25784024/a9fde4dc-3366-11e7-875e-4cfe3486954a.png" alt="main labeled" /><p class="caption"></span></p>
	</p>
<p>All panels are displayed horizontally on the screen in the order they are requested by end users, clicking on the proper menu icon.<br/> This navigation system choice makes it possible to present data efficiently and makes it easier for the user to navigate among components, giving also the chance to compare search results.<br/> It is possible to close a panel clicking on the <em>close icon</em> on the top right-hand corner of each panel, while the <em>escape</em> key allows closing the last panel displayed on the right of the screen.<br/> The default configuration of <strong>OWC</strong> application foresees the following menu options: - Login panel, which allows users to: * perform login (if already registered); * subscribe to application (if not yet registered); - User profile panel, which allows users to: * perform log-out; * access list of favourite products; * access list of saved searches; - Search container, which provides: * full text search functionality; * product footprint visualization on map; * product list; - Statistics container, which allows accessing the calendar of the <em>Product Availability</em>, reporting the publication density of products published on the DHuS with a sensing period covering the last 13 weeks. - Client settings, which allows users to configure: * application language; * application theme; * the list of map layers visualized on search container map; * product metadata to be shown in product list; - About panel, showing general information about the application.</p>
<h2 id="application-access">Application access</h2>
<p>Application access is free and allowed to all users registered to the Data Hub Service.<br/> Already registered users can play with OWC GUI after performing log-in by means of <em>Login Panel</em>.<br/> Not registered users can access OWC GUI after performing self-registration by means of <em>Signup Panel</em>.<br/></p>
<h3 id="login">Login</h3>
<p><em>Login Panel</em> is displayed on the browser clicking on application menu <em>login icon</em> <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10920750/25742254/f0f7a6b8-318e-11e7-9176-a75021ee49d7.png" alt="login_button" /></span></p>

	</span></p>
<p>Registered users insert their username and password in the proper fields and then click on the <em>LOGIN</em> button.<br/> If credentials are correctly inserted, a message <em>&quot;Logged in Successfully&quot;</em> appears in the bottom of the screen.<br/> If credentials are not correctly inserted (i.e. wrong username or password) an error message appears on the <em>Login Panel</em> (<em>&quot;The username and password you entered don't match.&quot;</em>)</p>
<h3 id="signup">Signup</h3>
<p><em>Signup Panel</em> is displayed on the browser by clicking on the <em>SIGNUP</em> button of the <em>Login Panel</em>. This button is visible on all the DHuS instances on which self-registration to service is allowed. <p><span class="image featured"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10920750/25746623/a7f5cb32-31a4-11e7-918b-ea6c1fe105ac.png" alt="self-registration" /></span></p>
<p>After filling all the fields of the registration form, the user has to click on the <em>REGISTER</em> button to send the registration request.<br/> If the registration form is not filled correctly, wrong fields are marked in red to inform user about registration failure.<br/> If the registration form is filled correctly, a message <em>&quot;Registration successful: An email was sent to let you validate your registration.&quot;</em> appears in the bottom of the screen.<br/> As reported in both <em>Signup Panel</em> and notification message, on completion of the registration process, new users will receive an e-mail with a link to validate the account. Clicking on the link reported in the e-mail, the account is enabled, so new users can start to play with the DHuS through <strong>OWC</strong> GUI.</p>
<p>Please note that the following special characters are not allowed for the generation of the username:</p>
<p>‐ &amp; | ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ &quot; ~ * ? : \ $ ' &lt;blank space&gt; <br/></p>
<p>The registration process cannot be completed when: - a field of the form is not filled in; - the username contains a special character; - the password is too short (minimum length: 8 characters); - the password typed in the &quot;Confirm Password&quot; field is not identical to the one typed in the corresponding &quot;Password&quot; field; - the e-mail typed in the &quot;Confirm E-mail&quot; field is not identical to the one typed in the corresponding &quot;E-mail&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong>Known registration issues:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Username already existing in the database</strong><br/> If a username is already existing in the Data Hub database a new account with the same username cannot be created. In this case, a generic error is notified to the user.</p>
<p><strong>No e-mail for registration confirmation is sent to the user</strong><br/> Registration e-mails are usually received within two minutes from registration. It is therefore suggested to try with a different username.</p>
<p><strong>User credentials are not sent via e-mail</strong><br/> Current Data Hub system does not send e-mails to the user with the username and password defined during the registration process. Please take care of writing down your credentials for future reference.</p>
<h2 id="search-container">Search container</h2>
<p><em>Search Container</em> is displayed on the browser by clicking on application menu <em>search icon</em> <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10920750/25785394/87bb650c-337f-11e7-9404-02d0e2fdcf36.png" alt="search" /><br/> It is possible to show 2 instances of search container at a time, allowing users to compare 2 searches results more easily.<br/> If a user requests a new <em>Search Container</em> when there are already 2 containers displayed, a message appears in the bottom of the screen as notification that no more instances can be created for the specified component (<em>&quot;Reached maximum number of component's instances&quot;</em>).</p>
<p>The <em>Search Container</em> is composed by 3 panels, which are collapsible and expandable clicking on the icon reported in the top left-hand corner of each panel: - <em>Search panel</em> - <em>Product list</em> - <em>Map</em></p>
<p><span class="image featured">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10920750/26936089-f0437a0e-4c6d-11e7-9266-d4334e99e1f5.png" alt="combo" /><p class="caption"></p>

<h3 id="search-panel">Search panel</h3>
<p><em>Search panel</em> contains a <strong>search bar</strong> used to insert text query to perform.<br/></p>
<p><span class="image featured">
<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10920750/25841108/2807b824-349f-11e7-8960-05b0460ffa77.png" alt="searchbar" /><p class="caption"></p>
	</span></p>
<p>Search request is executed clicking on the search icon in the end of the search bar.</p>
<p>The text query displayed in the search bar can be saved in a list of user's favourite searches, clicking on <em>save icon</em> <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10920750/25841330/f867ac72-349f-11e7-8d2e-abbb0e12c2e7.png" alt="saveicon" />.<br/>If the text query is saved successfully, a message appears in the bottom of the screen (<em>&quot;User search saved successfully&quot;</em>)</p>
<p>The text query displayed in the search bar can be also cleared, with all search filters, clicking on <em>clear icon</em> <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10920750/25841126/37772ac4-349f-11e7-8e83-f475faa9a2b4.png" alt="closeicon" />.<br/></p>
<p>Some text queries examples that can be typed in the full-text search bar, with available wildcards, operators and keywords, can be found at the following link: https://scihub.copernicus.eu/userguide/3FullTextSearch</p>
<h4 id="advanced-search">Advanced Search</h4>
<p>The <em>Search panel</em> contains a section with sort and ordering criteria and with different search fields.<br/></p>
<p>Available sort criteria are: - <strong>sort by product index</strong>, meaning that search results are displayed on the basis of the value of the selected index. Available indexes are: - Ingestion date, i.e. product publication date; - Sensing date, i.e. product acquisition date; - Cloud Coverage, i.e. product cloudiness percentage. - <strong>ascending or descending order</strong>, which, combined with the sorting criteria, allows to show search results: - from the more recent to the older one (<em>DESCENDING</em>) or viceversa (<em>ASCENDING</em>) in case of temporal index (e.g. Ingestion date or Sensing Date); - from the greater to the smaller value (<em>DESCENDING</em>) or viceversa (<em>ASCENDING</em>) in case of numeric index (e.g. Cloud Coverage).</p>
<p>In this section it's also possible to specify a date range for the following parameters: - <strong>Ingestion Date</strong>, in order to get all products published in the defined period. With regard to Ingestion time, the following convention is used: * Publication time equal or greater than 00:00:00 (hh:mm:ss) of the first selected date; * Publication time equal or less than 23:59:59 (hh:mm:ss) of the second selected date; - <strong>Sensing Date</strong>, in order to get all the products whose sensing dates are included in the defined period. With regard to sensing time, the following convention is used: * Sensing start time equal or greater than 00:00:00 (hh:mm:ss) of the first selected date; * Sensing stop time equal or less than 23:59:59 (hh:mm:ss) of the second selected date.</p>
<p>For both <em>Ingestion Date</em> and <em>Sensing Date</em> search criteria, the following rule is applied: - if only the first date is specified, the query will return all products with Ingestion/Sensing Date equal or greater than 00:00:00 (hh:mm:ss) of the specified date; - if only the second date is specified, the query will return all products with Ingestion/Sensing Date equal or less than 23:59:59 (hh:mm:ss) of the specified date; - if both first and second date are specified, the query will return all products with Ingestion/Sensing Date equal or greater than 00:00:00 (hh:mm:ss) of the first date and Ingestion/Sensing Date equal or less than 23:59:59 (hh:mm:ss) of the second date.</p>
<p>The date can be selected clicking on <em>calendar icon</em> <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10920750/25841125/3774499e-349f-11e7-9335-9764b7afc577.png" alt="calendaricon" />.<br/> The date can be cleared clicking on <em>clear date icon</em> <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10920750/25841127/377792b6-349f-11e7-9eac-857d9b106129.png" alt="clearcaledaricon" />.</p>
<p>These search fields can be used singularly or in combination with: - the full-text search bar content; - a selected geographic area.</p>
<h3 id="product-list">Product list</h3>
<p>The <em>Product list</em> provides all the products matching the submitted search query. Each result consists of: - product thumbnail, when available; - product main attributes, which are configurable by users on the basis of their needs. The configuration of product attributes is detailed in <a href="#link0001">List settings</a> section; - a set of available actions, such as: - open product details panel, clicking on <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10920750/25785356/8c127e66-337e-11e7-9bd0-33f791a94fdb.png" alt="show" /> icon reported in list item; - download a product, clicking on <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10920750/25785352/721f96ec-337e-11e7-827d-ba0fa32135b9.png" alt="download" /> icon reported in list item; - open auxiliary list panel, clicking on <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10920750/25785334/2db839b4-337e-11e7-96bd-50a1e0900f4d.png" alt="adf" />icon reported in list item; - add or remove product to/from user cart, clicking on the <em>star icon</em> <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10920750/25841129/37793d32-349f-11e7-8a12-56b9af4098e0.png" alt="staricon" /> shown in list item. If <em>star icon</em> is black coloured, this means that the product is not present in the user cart, so, clicking on the icon, the product is added to the user cart. If <em>star icon</em> is blue coloured, this means that the product is present in the user cart, so, clicking on the icon, the product is removed from user cart.</p>
<p>This component implements an <em>&quot;infinite scroll&quot;</em>. This means that after submitting a query, the list is populated with a number of products equals to a pre-defined page size (which is fixed to 25), but, as user scrolls product list, a new search is performed, according to the following rule: - if user scrolls down, a next product page (if any) is loaded; - if user scrolls up, a previous product page (if any) is loaded.</p>
<h4 id="product-details">Product details</h4>
