`authentication-manager` component is devoted to inject user credential in each http request performed within OWC application.
This component manages authentication towards application server in the following way:
- it checks for stored credentials at each http request
    - if there are stored credentials in session, the request is forwarded to server.
    - if there aren’t stored credentials, the login panel is shown, so that user can authenticate on the server.
      If credential  are valid, they are stored on session and the request is forwarded to server.
      If credential are not valid, an error message is shown to notify user about authentication failure.
Credentials are removed from session when current user logs out from the system.
