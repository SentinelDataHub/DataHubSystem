		<u><i>1. Introduction</i></u><br/>
      The Copernicus program is a cooperation of the European Union and the European Space Agency (ESA) for Earth observation. ESA coordinates the acquisition and delivery of Earth observation data from space. Starting with the successful launch of Sentinel-1A in 2014, the series of Sentinel satellites will deliver a wide range of data for environmental and civil security purposes.<br/>
      Under the ESA – European Community GMES Agreement of 28 February 2008, as amended subsequently, the agency is charged with managing the GMES Space Component (GSC) Programme.  A new agreement to be concluded between ESA and the European Union (EU), consistent with the EU Copernicus Regulation, will provide the legal framework for the continuation of ESA’s activities related to the Copernicus Space Component.<br/><br/>
      <u><i>2. Data supply</i></u><br/>
      The Sentinel Data Hub is an ESA online portal, which makes Sentinel data available to individuals and entities worldwide. The portal allows the searching for Sentinel data and the download of Sentinel data, selected by the user.<br/><br/>
      <u><i>3. Copyrights</i></u><br/>
      Any <b>Sentinel data</b> available through the Sentinel Data Hub will be governed by the <a href="https://sentinel.esa.int/documents/247904/690755/TC_Sentinel_Data_31072014.pdf">Terms and Conditions of the use and distribution of Sentinel data</a>, which the User is deemed to have accepted by using the Sentinel data.<br/>
      Any <b>other contents</b> of ESA's Sentinel Data Hub website are intended for non-commercial use. ESA grants permission to users to visit the site, and to download and copy information, images, documents and materials from the website for non-commercial use. ESA does not grant the right to resell or redistribute any information, documents, images or material from its website or to compile or create derivative works from material on its website. Use of material on the website is subject to the terms and conditions outlined below.<br/>
      All material published on the ESA Sentinel Online website is protected by copyright and owned or controlled by ESA or the party credited as the provider of the content, software or other material. Copyright in the material must be recognised by an appropriate on-screen credit in a form such as "European Space Agency - ESA". If a remote sensing product is being used, the credit "produced from ESA remote sensing data" must be added, plus, if applicable, "image processed by (name of the institution as indicated on the Internet Server)".<br/><br/>
      <u><i>4. User registration</i></u><br/>
      To access Sentinel data at the Sentinel Data Hub portal, individuals and entities need to register as a user and provide information to ESA. Through the registration, the user will be granted a password to access Sentinel data.<br/><br/>
      <u><i>5. Personal data privacy</i></u><br/>
      When the user accesses ESA's Sentinel Data Hub website, registers as a user or downloads content, certain information about users, such as internet protocol (IP) addresses, data downloaded, pages visited, software used and time spent, as well as other similar information, will be stored on ESA servers.<br/> 
      The collected information will be used by ESA only for the traffic analysis of the webpage, as well as for monitoring, reporting and communication regarding the distribution and use of Sentinel data towards ESA internal bodies, ESA Member States, the European Union and the general public. Whenever sharing user information with individuals or entities other than ESA, the data will be dealt with anonymously.<br/><br/>
      <u><i>6. Use of cookies</i></u><br/>
      Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual hard drive for record-keeping purposes; passwords are not saved in cookies. Cookies help ESA to know which pages are visited most often and helps ESA to ensure that its website responds to users' needs.<br/>

      <u><i>7. Availability of the Service</i></u><br/>
      ESA will make best efforts to provide the Sentinel data access service through the Sentinel data Hub. It is understood and recognised by all individuals and entities having accepted these Data Supply Conditions, that ESA is not in a position to guarantee the availability of Sentinel data through the Sentinel Data Hub.<br/>
      In particular, ESA reserves the right to review, modify, suspend or terminate the provision of Sentinel data through the Sentinel Data Hub at any time in the event:<br/>
      <ul> 
         <li style="margin-left: 20px">of technical capacity constraints due to the number of user requests</li>
         <li style="margin-left: 20px">of lack of sufficient funding for sustaining Sentinel missions, and associated facilities and activities,</li>
         <li style="margin-left: 20px">that satellite or ground system failure occurs,</li>
         <li style="margin-left: 20px">that planned activities of related Sentinel systems and facilities are suspended or cancelled in order for ESA to carry out activities considered of a higher priority.</li>
      </ul>
      The operating entity, i.e. ESA, may modify the Sentinels’ operations plans at any time, should it consider such corrective action necessary for ensuring the missions safety and success.<br/><br/>
      <u><i>8. Waiver of Liability</i></u><br/>
      With regard to the service offered by ESA through the Sentinel Data Hub portal, the user shall have no claim against ESA, its employees, related entities or employees of such entities, with respect to any injury to, or death of its own employees or employees of related entities or for damage to or loss of its own property or that of its related entities, whether such injury, death, damage or loss arise through negligence or otherwise, except in the case of gross negligence or wilful misconduct.<br/><br/>
      <u><i>9. Use of the Sentinel Data Hub</i></u><br/>
      By registering at the Sentinel Data Hub portal, accessing and\or downloading available Sentinel data, the user shall act in good faith and shall not misuse or interfere the service of the portal.
