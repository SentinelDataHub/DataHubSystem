			<h3>Terms of Sentinel Data Hub portal and Data supply conditions</h3>
			<div class="row">
				1. Introduction
	The Copernicus program is a cooperation of the European Union and the European Space Agency (ESA) for Earth observation. ESA coordinates the acquisition and delivery of Earth observation data from space. Starting with the successful launch of Sentinel-1A in 2014, the series of Sentinel satellites will deliver a wide range of data for environmental and civil security purposes.
	Under the ESA – European Community GMES Agreement of 28 February 2008, as amended subsequently, the agency is charged with managing the GMES Space Component (GSC) Programme. A new agreement to be concluded between ESA and the European Union (EU), consistent with the EU Copernicus Regulation, will provide the legal framework for the continuation of ESA’s activities related to the Copernicus Space Component.
